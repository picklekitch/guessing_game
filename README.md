Will doesn't have a readme - 
Will made a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that uses math.floor and Math.random to generate a random selection from the computer.
If user makes a selection that beats computer, you get a message telling you that you have deafeated the computer. If user selects a choice that the computer's random beats you get a message that you've lost, or that you and the computer have both lost.

#1 - let's figure out how to make code more DRY - eliminate obvious redundancies (console log AND alert messages that say the same thing)
#2 - Readability - add indentation.
#3 - Extended game to add alert that asks if user wants to paly again if user and computer tie.
Added score dialog to show user vs. computer score.
